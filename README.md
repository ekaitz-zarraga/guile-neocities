# Guile Neocities

Guile API and command line tool for [Neocities API](https://neocities.org/api).

If you wish to read some documentation, the `doc` folder should cover your
needs. If you want to read it in a better format, you can use `texinfo` to
convert it to Info, PDF or HTML.

If you want to play around with the command line tool, install it using the
documentation and just run `neocities --help` to learn how to use it.

If you are interested on the Guile API, you should take a look to the docs, and
use `neocities/cli.scm` as a source of simple and useful examples.
